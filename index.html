	<h3>Happy Number</h3>
	<p>A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
	Starting with any positive integer, 
	replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
	and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), 
	or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
	Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers</p>
